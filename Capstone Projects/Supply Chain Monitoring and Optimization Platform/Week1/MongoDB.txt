1. Sample Shipment Logs

use SupplyChainDB;

// Insert sample shipment log documents into shipment_logs collection
db.shipment_logs.insertMany([
  {
    ShipmentID: "SH1001",
    OrderID: 1,
    ShipmentDate: new Date("2025-06-01T10:30:00Z"),
    Carrier: "FedEx",
    Status: "In Transit",
    Destination: "123 Main St, City, Country",
    TrackingNumber: "FDX123456789",
    Items: [
      { ItemID: 1, ItemName: "Laptop Charger", Quantity: 30 },
      { ItemID: 2, ItemName: "SSD Drive", Quantity: 15 }
    ],
    Timestamp: new Date()
  },
  {
    ShipmentID: "SH1002",
    OrderID: 2,
    ShipmentDate: new Date("2025-06-02T14:00:00Z"),
    Carrier: "UPS",
    Status: "Delivered",
    Destination: "456 Another St, City, Country",
    TrackingNumber: "UPS987654321",
    Items: [
      { ItemID: 1, ItemName: "Laptop Charger", Quantity: 20 }
    ],
    Timestamp: new Date()
  }
]);


2. Create Indexes for Efficient Querying

// Index on ShipmentID for fast exact match lookups
db.shipment_logs.createIndex({ ShipmentID: 1 });

// Index on OrderID to quickly find shipment logs for a specific order
db.shipment_logs.createIndex({ OrderID: 1 });

// Compound index on Carrier and Status for filtering shipments by carrier and status
db.shipment_logs.createIndex({ Carrier: 1, Status: 1 });

// Index on ShipmentDate for date-range queries (e.g., recent shipments)
db.shipment_logs.createIndex({ ShipmentDate: 1 });
